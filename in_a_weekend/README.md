# About

This repo is based on the book [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
Code is translated from **C++** to **Rust** and follows the original code loosely while trying to preserve the intent.

## Status

Implemented things up until the defocus blur.
